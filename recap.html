<h1 id="pref">Prefaces A and B</h1>
<p>Humans always seem to push their capacity to reason further than it can
actually go, thereby entering the arena of 'metaphysics'. Historically, this has
always ended in confusion and falsehood, no matter how ostensibly careful the
various metaphysicians have been. The solution to this confusion is for reason
to arrive at a state of self knowledge. This will be done by critiquing the
faculty of reason insofar as it can cognize independently of experience. This is
equivalent, ultimately, to asking the questions: is metaphysics possible? and:
what is the origin of metaphysical thinking?</p>

<p>Disciplines that actually make progress (i.e. those that aren't metaphysics)
always have an <i>a priori</i> sense of what their objects are: the theoretical
disciplines determine their object <i>a priori</i> and then conceptualise it;
the practical disciplines determine the object <i>a priori</i> and then
actualise it. Metaphysical enquiry might benefit if it operates in a similar
way: as such, Kant assumes that <i>objects must conform to our cognition</i>,
rather than assuming - as metaphysics has historically done - that our cognition
always conforms to its objects.</p>

<p>Approaching metaphysics in this way, we can determine whether or not we are
describing the objects of metaphysics accurately by asking: does this conform to
the rules of our cognition?</p>

<p>This approach also has a disadvantage: it only permits us to cognize objects
insofar as we have 'provided' them with certain aspects (derived from the rules
of our cognition). This leads to the conclusion that any cognition beyond the
boundaries of possible experience is impossible. As such, most metaphysics in
the traditional sense of the word is impossible.</p>

<h1 id="intr">Introduction</h1>

<p>All cognition begins with experience, because the objects of experience are
required to produce a representation in the mind, by stimulating the senses. Not
all cognition <i>comes from</i> experience, however, since the understanding can
provide cognition without reference to particular objects of experience. It is
therefore precise to say: all cognition is "awoken" or "provoked" by experience.
Cognitions are built up of parts that are either sensuously intuited, or
provided by the understanding. Kant wants to ask: are there any cognitions that
are composed entirely of parts provided by the understanding? In other words:
<b>are there any <i>a priori</i> cognitions?</b></p>

<p><i>A priori</i> cognitions are the opposite of <i>a posteriori</i>
cognitions, which are <i>only possible through experience</i>. There are, in
fact, <i>a priori</i> cognitions that refer to experience; however, since their
experiential aspects are derived from general rules (rather than immediate
objects of experience), they are still <i>a priori</i>. Cognitions can therefore
be classified as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>A posteriori</i> cognitions, which are only possible through
        experience. <i>Example: "This particular house is big."</i></li>
    <li><i>A priori</i> cognitions, which can be justified without referring to
        experience. <i>Example: "Every change has a cause."</i> (Even though
        "change" is an empirical concept, it doesn't refer to any
        <i>particular</i> empirical thing; the cognition is therefore still <i>a
        priori</i>.</li>
    <li>Pure <i>a priori</i> cognitions, which contain <i>nothing empirical</i>.
        <i>Example: 2 + 4 = 6.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Only <i>a priori</i> cognitions can be <i>necessarily true</i>, because
the experience that makes up <i>a posteriori</i> cognitions only tells us how a
thing is – it doesn't tell us that the thing <i>cannot be otherwise</i>.</p>

<p>Now, we have already seen that <i>a priori</i> cognitions exist; some
examples have been given, and, furthermore, the fact that we know some things to
be necessarily true reveals that we already have some <i>a priori</i> cognitions
which provide this necessity. As such, part of the project for the
<i>Critique</i> is to determine how these <i>a priori</i> cognitions are
possible, and what fundamental principles they are grounded on.</p>

<p>Every judgment that we can make has one of two relations between the subject
and predicate. If the predicate inherently belongs to the subject, then the
judgment is <b>analytic</b>; it is a statement of clarification. Otherwise, the
judgment is <b>synthetic</b> and is a statement of amplification. Judgments of
experience are always synthetic, because experience always appends, rather than
clarifies - and analytic statements are mere clarifications. In other words:
since experience amplifies cognition, the judgments coming from experience are
also ampliative and are therefore synthetic. Kant's important question is: what
about synthetic judgments which are <i>a priori</i>? They must be ampliative,
but they cannot be amplified by experience. Comprehending the possibility of the
synthetic <i>a priori</i> is central to the <i>Critique</i>.
