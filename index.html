<h1>The Critique of Pure Reason</h1>
<h2>Preface to the First Edition</h2>

<p>Reason functions by beginning with fundamental principles that allow it
to make sense of nature. As it progresses, it abstracts from these principles
and reaches areas that are more and more remote; this continues until reason
reaches an inevitable stage at which it asks itself questions that it cannot
answer. This stage is known as <b>metaphysics</b>.</p>

<p>Metaphysics was once seen as the 'queen' of all the sciences; it is now
despised and seen as an outcast.</p>

<p>When metaphysics still reigned, <b>dogmatists</b> allowed it to 'rule
despotically'; but the dogmas of the different dogmatists clashed to such an
extent that <b>skeptics</b> came along and pushed all metaphysics and 'civil
unity' into disarray. Following this, the dogmatists would come again and try
to piece things back together, in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Some philosophers, such as Locke, tried to test the 'lawfulness' of these
different dogmatisms, by examining through a 'physiology' of human
understanding. But even though this rendered dogmatic thought as suspicious,
dogmatisms continued to assert themselves, since 'this genealogy was attributed
to [metaphysics] falsely'.</p>

<p>Following these pursuits, all of which were in vain, the general attitude
towards metaphysics was one best described as <b>indifferentism</b>. But it is
a kind of indifferentism that leads to metaphysical confusion in the first
place! The indifferentists, therefore, always fall back into metaphysics. This
phenomenon ought to be examined.</p>

<p>In this examination, a kind of 'court of justice' will be established, for
reason to arrive at a state of self-knowledge, wherein it can 'secure its
rightful claims while dismissing all its groundless pretensions â€¦ according to
its own eternal and unchangeable laws'. This court is the <b>critique of pure
reason</b>, the critique of the faculty of reason insofar as it can arrive
at cognitions <b>independently of experience</b>. It is therefore, at the same
time, an answer to the question of whether or not metaphysics is possible, and
of what the origin of metaphysical thinking is.</p>

<p>No questions in the critique of pure reason will be avoided by using reason's
inadequacy as an excuse; instead, they will be reformulated so as to accommodate
the nature of reason.</p>

<p>'Comprehensiveness' is the 'chief aim' of the critique, and as such it
answers all metaphysical problems. In fact, pure reason is rightly treated
as a 'pure unity'; as such, if any aspect of it was unsuitable for one
question, it would be discarded for all other questions: if it fails for one
question, it is unreliable for any others.</p>
