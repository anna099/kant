<h1 id="pref-a">Preface to the First Edition</h1>

<p>Reason functions by beginning with fundamental principles that allow it
to make sense of nature. As it progresses, it abstracts from these principles
and reaches areas that are more and more remote; this continues until reason
reaches an inevitable stage at which it asks itself questions that it cannot
answer. This stage is known as <b>metaphysics</b>.</p>

<p>Metaphysics was once seen as the 'queen' of all the sciences; it is now
despised and seen as an outcast.</p>

<p>When metaphysics still reigned, <b>dogmatists</b> allowed it to 'rule
despotically'; but the dogmas of the different dogmatists clashed to such an
extent that <b>skeptics</b> came along and pushed all metaphysics and 'civil
unity' into disarray. Following this, the dogmatists would come again and try
to piece things back together, in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Some philosophers, such as Locke, tried to test the 'lawfulness' of these
different dogmatisms, by examining through a 'physiology' of human
understanding. But even though this rendered dogmatic thought as suspicious,
dogmatisms continued to assert themselves, since 'this genealogy was attributed
to [metaphysics] falsely'.</p>

<p>Following these pursuits, all of which were in vain, the general attitude
towards metaphysics was one best described as <b>indifferentism</b>. But it is
a kind of indifferentism that leads to metaphysical confusion in the first
place! The indifferentists, therefore, always fall back into metaphysics. This
phenomenon ought to be examined.</p>

<p>In this examination, a kind of 'court of justice' will be established, for
reason to arrive at a state of self-knowledge, wherein it can 'secure its
rightful claims while dismissing all its groundless pretensions … according to
its own eternal and unchangeable laws'. This court is the <b>critique of pure
reason</b>, the critique of the faculty of reason insofar as it can arrive
at cognitions <b>independently of experience</b>. It is therefore, at the same
time, an answer to the question of whether or not metaphysics is possible, and
of what the origin of metaphysical thinking is.</p>

<p>No questions in the critique of pure reason will be avoided by using reason's
inadequacy as an excuse; instead, they will be reformulated so as to accommodate
the nature of reason.</p>

<p>'Comprehensiveness' is the 'chief aim' of the critique, and as such it
answers all metaphysical problems. In fact, pure reason is rightly treated
as a 'pure unity'; as such, if any aspect of it was unsuitable for one
question, it would be discarded for all other questions: if it fails for one
question, it is unreliable for any others.</p>

<p>Kant acknowledges that his promises sound immodest; however, he argues that
they are more modest than the philosophers that claim to possess knowledge on
the human 'soul' or on the beginning of the universe. Kant merely promises to
gain an exhaustive understanding of the human faculty of reason. The critique
of pure reason only concerns itself with the claims that can be made with
necessity.</p>

<p>The book is difficult, but Kant suggests that 'many a book would have been
much clearer if it had not been made quite so clear': giving too many examples,
illustrations, and reductions of complicated topics into common concepts might
help to clarify a part, but will only confuse the whole.</p>

<h1 id="pref-b">Preface to the Second Edition</h1>

<p>Is the examination of the cognitions of pure reason a science? If, while
we are carrying it out, we find ourselves having to scrap our progress and
go down another path; if we get completely stuck after making sensible
preliminaries; if we can never agree on how to establish our path in the first
place – in any of these cases, we will realise that it is not a science.</p>

<p>Logic, for example, has never had to reroute itself since the time of
Aristotle. Nor has it found the need to take extra steps – apart from those
which have been psychological, metaphysical, or anthropological, all of which
Kant dismisses as distortions of the boundaries of logic as a science. Logic
has had such success because it concerns itself only with the form of
understanding, and is abstracted away from all potential objects of
cognition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is more difficult when a science considers not only
cognition but the objects of cognition. Whenever a science has an object, it
must involve some <i>a priori</i> cognition: either the object is determined
and its concept is brought about, or the object is actualised. The former
kind of reasoning is <b>theoretical</b>; the latter is <b>practical</b>. In
both kinds of reasoning, the kind of object that the reasoning concerns itself
with is determined <i>a priori</i>, or else the reasoning would end up being
misapplied, 'for it is bad economy to spend blindly'.</p>

<p>Unlike mathematics and the natural sciences, which have managed to earn the
status of being scientific, metaphysics has always lost itself – despite the
aforementioned fact that metaphysical thinking seems to be forced upon us by
nature. We might, therefore, reflect on what kinds of thinking have been
beneficial for mathematics and the natural sciences, and approach metaphysics
with a similar kind of thinking.</p>

<p>We have typically assumed that all cognition must conform to its objects;
however, at least in the case of metaphysics, this has got us nowhere. At least
for the sake of experiment, then, it is worthwhile to approach metaphysics with
the assumption that objects must conform to our cognition. This would allow us
to have an <i>a priori</i> idea of what our objects are which, as previously
argued, is required for scientific thinking.</p>

<p>Approaching metaphysics in this (scientific) manner will allow us to
determine if we are getting an accurate picture of the objects of metaphysics,
simply by asking: does this conform to the rules of our cognition? Admittedly,
this strength also comes with the disadvantage that we can only make <i>a
priori</i> cognitions of objects regarding those aspects that we ourselves have
'put into' them. This also means that we cannot go beyond the boundaries of
possible experience which, at least traditionally, is the purpose of
metaphysics.</p>

<p>If we go along with the assumption that objects conform to our knowledge,
then we must accept that all of our cognitions only reach the <b>appearances</b>
of things; there is therefore an <b>unconditioned</b> aspect of things in
themselves which we cannot cognize, and it is this unconditioned that drives us
towards the confusions of metaphysical thinking. Importantly, the notion of
the unconditioned is only possible if we accept that objects conform to
knowledge; if we make the opposite assumption, the notion of the unconditioned
is contradictory.</p>

<p>Having accepted that theoretical reason cannot cognize the unconditioned,
Kant claims that we must test whether or not practical reason can make such
cognitions:</p>
<blockquote>
  "What still remains for us is to try whether there are not data in
  reason's practical data for determining that transcendent rational concept of
  the unconditioned, in such a way as to reach beyond the boundaries of all
  possible experience, in accordance with the wishes of metaphysics, cognitions
  <i>a priori</i> that are possible, but only from a practical standpoint".
  <b>(Bxxi)</b>
</blockquote>
<p>This is done in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>.</p>

<p>What will be the results of a critique of pure reason? Firstly, we will be
given a system of principles in which each principle depends upon all the
others; no principle can be taken with certainty on its own unless it works
in relation to the entirety of pure reason. Since these principles are based
solely off of the structure of human reasoning, they will never be appended to
or subtracted from; as such, once (critical) metaphysics has established itself
as a science, it can be laid 'down for posterity', as a <b>complete
framework</b>. This is a unique luxury that the natural sciences don't have.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there is a <b>negative</b> side to critical metaphysics, in that
it is strict about the limitation of pure reason, 'teaching us never to venture
with speculative reasoning beyond the boundaries of experience'. However, it is
actually <b>positive</b> insofar as it completely prevents the negative
consequences of pre-critical metaphysics: namely, the tendency to go beyond
the limits of experience and thereby limits (or even prevents) the use of
practical reasoning. As such, the critique of pure reason is giving a greater
respect to the requirements of practical moral reasoning.</p>

<p>It has already been established that the critique will show that we cannot
cognize things as they are in themselves. This doesn't mean, however, that we
cannot even <i>think</i> of things in themselves; we can, because without such
an ability we would have to assume that there are representations without
things to represent. This twofold conception of the object also allows us to
consider particular things in twofold manners – for example, to consider the
human soul as sensibly determined by the laws of nature, but intellectually (in
itself) free. I cannot <i>cognize</i> myself as free, but I can <i>think</i>
myself to be that way, without any contradiction. This is a requirement of
moral practical reasoning, because without freedom there can be no moral
decisions. It is also, Kant will argue, necessary to assume the existence of
God and immortality for practical reasoning to succeed, and these assumptions
cannot be made without the limitations that the critical project places on
pure reason.</p>

<p>The critique of pure reason is therefore a beneficial project. Kant defends
this point further by pointing out that the endeavours of pre-critical
metaphysics – ontological and cosmological arguments for God, defences of free
will on the basis of 'powerless distinctions', and so on – have never actually
benefitted the public, only the scholars. As such, the systematic disproval of
these endeavours is only a drawback to scholars who wish to speculate endlessly
without concern for social or pedagogical benefit.</p>

<p>Critical philosophy isn't critical of <b>dogmatic procedure</b> – the
procedure of pure reason is always dogmatic, since it secures its principles
with necessity. Instead, it is critical of <b>dogmatism</b>, which can be
defined as dogmatic procedure 'without an antecedent critique of its own
capacity'. According to Kant, such an antecedent critique of the 'organ' of
reason was the only thing preventing Wolff from completing a systematic and
scientific metaphysics.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Introduction (revised in B)</h1>

<h3>I. On the difference between pure and empirical cognition.</h3>
<p><b>All cognition begins with experience</b>, since it is only objects that
can stimulate the senses and thereby produce a representation in the mind.
However, although cognition begins <i>with</i> experience, it doesn't
necessarily arise <i>from</i> experience. This is because our cognitions may
be composed of both that which is <b>sensuously intuited</b>, and also that
which our <b>cognitive faculty (the understanding) provides</b>, after merely
being "awoken" or "provoked" by sensuous intuition. With philosophical
practice, we can separate cognitions into their sensory and rational
components.</p>

<p>We have established that all cognitions are brought to stage with experience,
and that they are built up of components that are either sensuously intuited, or
provided by the cognitive faculty. We may still ask, then: are there any
cognitions which are composed <i>entirely</i> of that which our cognitive
faculty provides? Though these cognitions would <i>begin with experience</i> –
that is to say, they will be "provoked" by experience – they may have their
<i>content</i> determined entirely independently of that experience.</p>

<p>This question can be rephrased as, <b>are there any <i>a priori</i>
cognitions?</b> Such cognitions are distinguished from <i>a posteriori</i>
cognitions, which have their sources in experience.</p>

<p>But, in fact, this definition of <i>a posteriori</i> cognitions isn't
precise enough, because some cognitions that have experience as their source
seem to be arrived at <i>a priori</i>, because the experiential sources aren't
<i>immediate</i> but instead derived from <i>general rules</i> that are
"borrowed from experience". Here, Kant seems to be alluding to Hume's notion of
"custom". Kant's example is that we know <i>a priori</i> that a house without
foundations will collapse, without having to have seen <i>this particular
house</i> have its foundations undermined. But this is not known <i>purely a
priori</i>, because – as it has been explained – the 'rules' it relies upon
are borrowed from experience.</p>

<p>Following this clarification, Kant categorises different cognitions as
follows:
  <ul>
    <li>Empirical or <i>a posteriori</i> cognitions are those that are
      only possible through experience. <i>e.g. "This house is big".</i></li>
    <li><i>A priori</i> cognitions are those that can be justified without
      referring to experience. <i>e.g. "Every alteration has its cause"</i> –
      note how "alteration" is an empirical concept, but the cognition
      itself is still <i>a priori</i>, because "alteration" doesn't refer to
      an empirical <i>particular</i>.</li>
    <li>Pure <i>a priori</i> cognitions are those in which <i>nothing</i>
      empirical is 'intermixed'. <i>e.g. 2 + 2 = 4</i></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Note: the distinction between "pure" and "impure" <i>a priori</i>
cognitions seems to be very unclear in Kant. As such, the categorisation above
might not be entirely accurate. Kant introduces the categorisation in B3.</p>

<h3>II. We are in possession of certain <i>a priori</i> cognitions, and even
  the common understanding is never without them.</h3>
<p>If a proposition is <b>necessary</b>, then it must be <i>a priori</i>,
because experience tells only that a thing is how it is – it doesn't teach us
that the thing cannot be otherwise. In addition to this, if a proposition has
genuine necessity – that is, there cannot be any conceivable exception to it –
then it must be <i>a priori</i>, since experience only gives us an 'assumed'
universality through induction.</p>

<p>There are examples of statements that are entirely <i>a priori</i> and,
therefore, (truly) universal and necessary. The most obvious examples are the
statements of mathematics. "Every effect has its cause" is also an example
because the understanding's concept of "cause" undeniably contains the concept
of "effect"; if they were to be in any way hypothetically separated, as they are
in Hume's work, and derived from mere "subjective necessity" – that is, custom
or habit.</p>

<p>Even without giving examples, the existence of <i>a priori</i> cognitions
cannot be doubted, because they are a necessary condition for all experience.
What would give any empirical experience its certainty if all principles it
relied upon were also empirical? The existence of <i>a priori</i> cognitions
is also a necessary condition for the existence of concepts: take any empirical
concept, such as <b>a body</b>, and remove everything empirical from it (the
colour, texture, weight, etc) – the fact that it still exists in <b>space</b>
cannot be removed. This is because space is an <i>a priori</i> intuition. As
such, it is undeniable that our understanding possesses certain <i>a
priori</i> cognitions.</p>

<h3>III. Philosophy needs a science that determines the possibility, the
  principles, and the domain of all cognitions <i>a priori</i>.</h3>
<p>As already established, the human understanding typically desires to find
cognitions that cannot be verified by any possible experience and that therefore
'go beyond' the realm of experience. The study of these cognitions is
metaphysics, and it is consistently undertaken as a form of dogmatism, without
any preliminary critique of the organ (i.e. reason) that it uses. The topics
it typically concerns itself with are <b>God, immortality, and freedom</b>.</p>

<p>Since this kind of dogmatism, by very nature of the cognitions it focuses on,
cannot be refuted by experience, it is only a critique of pure reason that can
actually refute it, unless a dogmatist herself realises that her work has
reached an obvious contradiction. This is likely to happen since, when a
dogmatist frees themselves of the bounds of experience, their 'drive for
expansion' no longer has any limits. This drive is so strong that some people
may speculate to an absurd extent, and then make excuses to justify the
groundlessness of their speculations.</p>

<p>The critique of pure reason doesn't need to worry about this kind of trouble,
because it is primarily concerned with <b>analysing concepts that we already
have of objects</b>. This gives us illuminations and clarifications of our
existing cognitions, which can themselves be treated as new cognitions for their
ability to ground a future metaphysics. Real progress is made, therefore, by
these <i>a priori</i> cognitions, and at first this seems contrary to the very
definition of an <i>a priori</i> cognition. However, Kant points out, there are
in fact some <i>a priori</i> cognitions which aren't simply tautological. The
next section deals with the distinction of these cognitions from 'ordinary'
<i>a priori</i> cognitions.</p>

<h3>IV. On the difference between analytic and synthetic judgements.</h3>
<p>In all judgements (combinations of intuitions and cognitions of the
understanding) where the relation is given between a subject and a predicate of
the subject, there are two possible relations. Firstly, predicate B inherently
belongs to subject A. Secondly, predicate B lies outside of subject A. The
former kind of judgement is called <b>analytic</b> and is a <b>judgement of
clarification</b>; the latter is called <b>synthetic</b> and is a <b>judgement
of amplification</b>.</p>

<p>Judgements of experience are <i>always synthetic</i>, since analytic
statements needn't go beyond a mere clarification of a concept, and experience
appends rather than clarifies. In other words, <b>experience works to amplify
cognition</b>.</p>

<p>Synthetic judgements that are <i>a priori</i>, however, must be amplified
differently. If I cannot resort to experience to amplify concept A in an <i>a
priori</i> judgement, what do I use instead? As an example, take the proposition
that <i>"everything that happens has a cause"</i> (note the different wording
to the previous [analytic] proposition, "every alteration has a cause"). With
the concept of <i>something that happens</i>, we can extract the concept of 'an
existence that was preceded by a time, etc.', but at no point will we be able
to extract from it the concept of <i>cause</i>. The idea of a cause does not
belong to the idea of a thing that happens in general. What is it that allows
us to make this proposition <i>a priori</i>, then? It cannot be experience,
since (as has already been established) experience only provides particulars,
without the <i>necessity</i> that <i>a priori</i> judgements have. This question
(of how synthetic <i>a priori</i> statements are possible) is central to the
critique of pure reason.</p>

<h3>V. Synthetic <i>a priori</i> judgements are contained as principles in all
  theoretical sciences of reason.</h3>
<p>1. Statements of mathematics are always synthetic <i>a priori</i>; for
example, in the sum '7 + 5 = 12', the number 12 is necessarily the result but
isn't implicit in the concept of merely pairing the numbers 7 and 5. No
elaboration on or clarification of this pair of numbers will extract the number
12; the statement is therefore ampliative (i.e. synthetic) and, obviously,
necessary (i.e. <i>a priori</i>).</p>

<p>2. The natural sciences contain synthetic <i>a priori</i> statements amongst
their principles. For example, physics holds as a principle that during all
changes of the material world, the quantity of matter remains the same. This is
both necessary and ampliative, since there is no clarification of the concept of
matter that will reach the concept of persistence. The principle is therefore
synthetic <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<p>3. Metaphysics itself, even though it has previously not made successful
progress as a science, is supposed to contain synthetic <i>a priori</i>
statements, since it isn't concerned with merely taking the concepts that our
cognition already provides and creating clarifications of them; it is instead
oriented towards <i>amplifying</i> these concepts to a point that is further
than experience can go.</p>

<h3>VI. The general problem of pure reason.</h3>
<p>The primary task of the critique of pure reason is made much lighter by the
fact that it can be generally expressed in one question: <b>"How are synthetic
judgements <i>a priori</i> possible?"</b> The status of metaphysics depends on
this question; the historically consistent failure of metaphysics has perhaps
been due to its lack of engagement with this question. David Hume got the
closest to such an investigation, but effectively failed when he refused to
generalise it and focused only on statements that connect cause with effect;
his result was to conclude that these statements are in fact <i>not a priori</i>
and only appear to be as the result of an illusion after mere habit had created
the concepts of cause and effect merely by borrowing from experience. If he had
taken his conclusion further, he would have had to conclude that  iepure
mathematics is also impossible, since (as has been shown) it contains synthetic
<i>a priori</i> statements.</p>

<p>Contained within our question regarding the synthetic <i>a priori</i> are the
questions regarding the grounding of many applications of reason: for example,
<b>How is pure mathematics possible?</b> and <b>How are pure natural sciences
possible?</b> Also, regardless of whether or not it becomes established as a
science, we cannot deny that the questions of metaphysics arise from a certain
natural predisposition in the mind. The critique will therefore also ask:
<b>How is metaphysics as a natural predisposition possible?</b> Beyond this,
however, we have to examine the objects of the questions of metaphysics, and
whether or not they actually lie within the bounds of reason. The final question
of the critique is therefore: <b>How is metaphysics possible as science?</b>

<p>The science that the critique will establish will not be 'extensive', since
it will be concerned not with the <i>objects</i> of metaphysical questions, but
with <i>the questions themselves</i>. Any other attempt would be dogmatic, and
dogmatic use of reason leads to groundlessness, which leads to skepticism. With
the critique of pure reason, all previous (i.e. dogmatic) attempts at
metaphysics are undone.</p>

<h3>VII. The idea and division of a special science under the name of a critique
  of pure reason.</h3>
<p>Reason provides principles of all cognition <i>a priori</i>. An
<b>organon</b> of pure reason would be a complete list of all these principles.
This, however, might not be possible; instead, then, the <i>Critique</i> resorts
to a <b>propaedeutic</b> of pure reason, which examines the <i>sources and
boundaries</i> of such principles. This is not <i>doctrine</i> but
<i>critique</i>, since it aims not to amplify our reason but to purify it
and kepe it free of errors.</p>

<p>All cognition that is concerned not with objects but with our mode of
<i>a priori</i> cognition of objects is called <i>transcendental</i>. A
system of concepts built from such cognition is called <i>transcendental
philosophy</i>. But any such system would be too broad for the mere
propaedeutic that the <i>Critique</i> hopes to achieve, since we are only
concerned with one kind of cognition – synthetic <i>a priori</i>. This
investigation serves as <i>the preparation for an organon</i>. This should
be possible, since we are not concerened with the (inexhaustible) nature of
things, but with the finite <i>a priori</i> capacity of our finite
understanding.</p>

<p>We also shouldn't expect a critique of historical books and systems of
reason, since such a critique can only hope to find any grounding following
a critique of the understanding, prior to any (groundless) systematisation.</p>

<p>Transcendental philosophy is the system of the principles of pure reason.
The critique of pure reason forms an architectonic plan for such a system. As
such, the <i>Critique</i> presents the 'complete idea of transcendental
philosophy', but 'not yet this science itself'.</i>

<p>The most important distinction of transcendental philosophy is that it must
contain zero concepts that are in any way empirical – its cognitions must be
purely <i>a priori</i>. As such, principles of morality do not enter the
science, because they consider the concept of incentive.</p>

<p>The <i>Critique</i> is split into two parts: a <b>Doctrine of Elements</b>
and a <b>Doctrine of Method</b>. All that is left to be said in terms of an
introduction is this: human cognition has two stems – the sensibility, through
which objects are given to us, and the understanding, through which they are
thought. The first part of the doctrine of elements will examine if the
sensibility has <i>a priori</i> representations that determine how objects
are given to us.</p>

<h1 id="trans-aes">Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, first part:
  <i>The Transcendental Aesthetic</i></h1>

<p>Cognition is immediately directed at object through <b>intuition</b>. All
thought as a means is directed to the end of intuition. However, this is only
possible if the object is given to us and if it affects the mind in a certain
way. Our capacity to receive objects is called the <b>sensibility</b>, and it
is the sensibility that give us intuitions. These are processed in thought by
the <b>understanding</b>, which gives rise to <b>concepts</b>. All thought must
ultimately be related to intuitions, whether directly or indirectly, since
there is no other way that objects can be given to us.</p>

<p>The effect an object has on our capacity for representation is called
<b>sensation</b>. Intuitions which are related to their objects through
sensation are called <b>empirical</b>. The <b>undetermined</b> objects of
empirical intuitions are called <b>appearances</b>.</p>

<p>In an appearance, that which corresponds to its sensation is called the
<b>matter</b>; the particular ordering of the manifold appearance is called
<b>form</b>. Form, being that which orders sensations, cannot itself be given
in sensation; as such, it must lie in the mind <i>a priori</i>; sensation, on
the other hand, is <i>a posteriori</i>.</p>

<p>A representation is <b>pure</b> if it contains nothing derived from
sensation. One such pure representation is the form of sensible intuitions as
such. This is encountered in the mind <i>a priori</i>, and is also referred to
as <b>pure intuition</b>. If I take a representation, and subtract from it
everything that the understanding thinks about it (substance, force,
divisibility, and so on), and then subtract everything that comes from
sensation (hardness, colour, texture, and so on), that which is left comes from
pure intuition. This remainder, namely, is <b>extension</b> and <b>form</b>.
These come <i>a priori</i> from the mind, rather than coming from an object
given in sensation.</p>

<p>The transcendental aesthetic is the science of the principles of <i>a
priori</i> sensibility. The science of the principles of pure <i>thinking</i>
is the transcendental logic.</p>

<p>In the transcendental aesthetic, everything that the understanding thinks
about representations will be pushed aside, and then everything that is given
to representations through sensation will be pushed aside; all that remains will
be that which is provided through <i>pure intuition</i>, the mere form of
appearances in general. The investigation will find that there are two pure
forms of intuition: <b>space</b> and <b>time</b>.</p>

<h3 id="on-space"><u>First Section: On Space</u></h3>

<p>Our mind possesses 'outer sense' which allows objects to be represented to
us as outside of us, in space. Their size, position, shape, and so on, is all
determined in space. The mind also possesses 'inner sense', which does not give
us a intuition of the soul itself, but provides an intuition of the mind's
inner state. Because of this inner sense, everything that is determined within
the mind is represented as being in time. Therefore: space is always and only
intuited as something <i>outside</i> us; time is always and only intuited as
something <i>within</i> us.</p>

<p>What are space and time? They might be actual <b>entities</b>; they might be
merely <b>relations between things</b>, that would exist even without the things
being intuited; they may alternatively be <b>relations attached to
intuitions</b>, therefore belong only to the constitution of the mind, and not
to the things themselves. To answer this question, we will first consider space,
by representing (even if not completely) that which belongs to the concept of
space.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Space is not an empirical concept drawn from outer experiences. Because,
  in order for something to be represented as 'outside' me, I must already have
  a representation of space to serve as the ground of this outsideness. In
  other words, space cannot come from outer experiences, because 'outer
  experience' is only possible through a representation of space.</li>
  <li>As established above, space is an <i>a priori</i> representation that
  provides the ground for outer experience. It is therefore <i>necessary</i>:
  I cannot represent the non-existence of space, and all appearances in general
  have space as the condition of their possibility.</li>
  <li>Space is not the general concept of things' relations in general; it is
  a <i>pure intuition</i>. The mind can only represent one single space that may
  be divided into parts – it cannot represent multiple spaces. The parts that
  space can be divided into cannot precede the single, overarching space,
  because they must necessarily be represented as being <b>in</b> the latter.
  It follows, then, that space is grounded in an <i>a priori</i> intuition. For
  this reason, all geometric truths are derived not from general empirical
  concepts, but are instead arrived at with apodictic certainty through <i>a
  priori</i> certainty.</li>
  <li>The <b>original representation</b> of space is not a concept. Space is
  represented as an infinite <b>given</b> magnitude. Admittedly, concepts are
  necessarily thought of as individual representations under the presumably
  infinite set of all concepts, but no concept itself is thought of as
  <b>containing</b> infinite representations.  Therefore space, having infinite
  magnitude, cannot be thought of as a concept, but must be thought of as an
  <i>a priori</i> intuition. <b>Note:</b> I have emphasised 'original
  representation' because I think it is particularly significant to this
  passage. On the surface, Kant seems to be denying that space is a concept,
  only to subsequently write about it as a concept (see the heading below). I
  don't think he has actually made this mistake; I think that instead, he only
  argues that the <i>original representation</i> of space – that is, the initial
  way it is represented to consciousness, and the way from which all
  (potentially <i>conceptual</i>) cognition can be built – is non-conceptual
  (or, perhaps, 'pre-conceptual').</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Transcendental Exposition of the Concept of Space.</h3>
<p>A transcendental exposition is an explanation of a concept as a
<i>principle</i> that allows certain synthetic <i>a priori</i> cognitions to be
made. Such an explanation can only be carried out if this synthetic cognitions
genuinely stem from the principle in focus, and if they are <i>only possible</i>
on the condition of the principle.</p>

<p>Geometry is a science that determines particular properties of space. It does
so <i>a priori</i>, and its statements are ampliative. As such, the
representation of space that geometry makes use of must be an <i>intuition</i>,
and not a concept, since concepts can only be analysed, without any ampliative
results. This intuition of space must also be <i>a priori</i>, since the
cognitions of geometry for which it serves as the condition of possibility are
<i>necessary</i> or <i>apodictic</i>.

<p>How can an outer intuition like space (see <a href="#on-space">here</a>) be
<i>a priori</i>? The only answer is that space is an <b>immediate
representation</b> in the mind, as part of the mind's constitution for receiving
intuitions of objects. Only this answer explains the possibility of synthetic
<i>a priori</i> cognitions regarding space (i.e. cognitions of geometry, in this
case).</p>

<h3>Conclusions from the above concepts.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Space is not merely a property of objects and nor is it merely a relation
  of things to one another, since such properties and relations can only be
  thought of after the intuition of an object, and therefore cannot be intuited
  <i>a priori</i>; yet we do make cognitions of space <i>a priori</i>.</li>
  <li>Space is nothing but the form of all outer intuition – it is therefore
  the condition of possibility for sensibility as such. We can only speak of it
  from a 'human standpoint' – that is, we can only speak of it with regard to
  how it determines our reception of objects in outer intuition. Space must be
  understood as a condition of possibility for <i>appearances</i> of objects,
  and not of the objects themselves. The proposition 'all things are next to
  each other in space' is only true with the limitation that 'things' designates
  things <i>as they are represented to us</i>. The proposition 'all things, as
  outer intuitions, are next to each other in space' is universally true. We
  can therefore say that space is <b>empirically real</b> (i.e. it is real with
  respect to all outer intuition) but <b>transcendentally ideal</b>: it is
  nothing as soon as we leave the scope of objects represented as outer
  intuitions. Outer objects in themselves aren't known to us at all; we are
  only aware of them as they are represented to us through the 'lens' of such
  <i>a priori</i> intuitions like space.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Second Section: On Time</u></h3>

<h3>Metaphysical exposition of the concept of time.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Time is not an empirical concept drawn from experience, because the very
  possibility of perceiving multiple things as existing simultaneously or in
  sequence <i>relies</i> upon their grounding in the concept of time <i>a
  priori</i>.</li>
  <li>Time is a necessary representation that serves as the condition of
  possibility for <i>all representations</i>. You cannot remove from an
  appearance the fact that the appearing object exists in time.</li>
  <li>The necessity of time is also the condition of possibility for necessary
  and <i>a priori</i> statements to be made about time. For example: that
  different times are <i>successive</i> and not <i>simultaneous</i> (in the
  same way that different spaces are simultaneous and not successive). Such
  principles aren't derived from experience; if they were, they wouldn't
  hold necessity.</li>
  <li>Time is not a discursive concept (i.e. a concept derived merely from the
  relations between things); instead, it is a <b>pure form of sensible
  intuition</b>. Different times are simply parts of one single time. All
  necessary principles regarding time (as described above) are contained
  inherently within time as a pure intuition.</li>
  <li>The original representation of time is infinite and unlimited; every
  limited amount of time is grounded on a limitation of the single, unlimited
  time that is already intuited.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Transcendental exposition of the concept of time.</h3>
<p>The concepts of alteration and motion are only possible through the
representation of time. If the mind possessed no <i>a priori</i> inner intuition
of time, then things could not be represented as undergoing alteration or
motion.

<h3>Conclusions from these concepts.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Time is not something that is simply attached to things as an additional
  determination; it is the <i>grounding</i> of the representations of these
  things in the first place. If it were just an objective determination to be
  appended to representations, then we could represent 'time' without any
  object, and this is not possible.</li>
  <li id="timis">Time is merely the <b>form of inner sense</b> – it is not
  something that determines outer appearances, since it clearly has no shape or
  position. Instead, it is that which determines the relation of
  representations in the mind's inner state. We also know that the
  representation of time is an intuition since it can be <i>expressed</i> in an
  outer intuition – for instance, when we picture time as a two-dimensional
  line stretching into the past and future.</li>
  <li>Time is the condition of possibility for <i>all representations</i>.
  Space, on the one hand, only determines the representation of outer things,
  since objects represented as within the mind don't take place in space.
  However, all objects – whether they are 'inner' or 'outer' – take place in
  time and are therefore grounded upon the <i>a priori</i> intuition of
  time. To be precise, we should say not that 'all things are in time', but
  that 'all things as appearances (or objects of sensible intuition) are in
  time'. The latter statement is <i>a priori</i> and therefore universal and
  objective. Just like space, then, time is <b>empirically real</b>, meaning
  that it is objectively real and valid with regard to objects given to our
  senses and represented to us; and it is <b>transcendentally ideal</b>, being
  reduced to nothing if we abstract from subjective sensible intuition.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Elucidation.</u></h3>
<p>There is an objection to the claim that time is empirically real but only
transcendentally ideal. The objection claims that <i>alterations</i> are real –
which is proved by the change of our representations – and that alterations can
only occur within time; as such, time must be real. Kant simply concedes to this
criticism: yes, time is something real – it is the <b>real form of inner
intuition</b>. It shouldn't be regarded as an object, but as the way I represent
myself to myself as an object. This is the <i>empirical</i> reality that Kant
ascribes to time; it is only <i>absolute</i> reality that it doesn't
possess.</p>

<p>Time and space are two sources of cognition, and they are the pure forms of
all sensible intuition. This is how they grant the possibility of synthetic
<i>a priori</i> propositions. Time and space, as sources of cognition, are
limited by the fact that they are conditions only of <i>sensibility</i> and not
of <i>things</i>; as such, the cognition they enable applies only to things
as appearances, rather than things as they are in themselves.</p>

<p>The transcendental aesthetic only contains space and time, since any other
concepts that belong to sensibility can be proved to have empirical
presuppositions. For example, even a concept so simple as <b>motion</b> is
empirically sourced, since it relies not only on the <i>a priori</i> intuition
of space, but also on an empirical observation of something movable – that is,
an observation made <b>through experience</b>. Space itself (as an <i>a
priori</i> intuition) does not contain the concept of movement.</p>

<h3>General remarks on the transcendental aesthetic.</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All intuition is nothing but the representation of appearance. We do not
  represent things as they are in themselves; if we remove all the subjective
  constitution of the sensibility from our representations, all relations of
  things in space and time – and even space and time themselves – would
  vanish. Whatever the case is with these objects in themselves is 'entirely
  unknown to us'.
  <hr>Space and time are the pure forms of our perception, and sensation as such
  is its content. The former are provided <i>a priori</i>, and as such are
  known as <b>pure intuitions</b>; the latter is what is responsible for all
  <i>a posteriori</i> cognition (i.e. empirical intuition).
  <hr>Sensible knowledge and conceptual knowledge are of different <i>kind</i>
  and not just of different <i>quality</i>, as Leibniz claimed (arguing that
  'our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused representation of
  things'). Knowledge of the sensibility is always particular; conceptual
  knowledge is always universal.
  <hr>The transcendental aesthetic isn't just a plausible hypothesis; it holds
  as much certainty as we can expect from a theory. This certainty is evident
  from the fact that we have synthetic <i>a priori</i> knowledge: synthetic
  knowledge cannot be derived only from concepts, since concepts can only be
  further elucidated to produce analytic (tautological) statements. As such,
  synthetic knowledge must make use of an intuition. But if this intuition were
  sensible – given to us <i>a posteriori</i> – then our synthetic knowledge
  wouldn't hold necessity (and our synthetic <i>a priori</i> knowledge of
  geometry, for example, does). As such, in making synthetic <i>a priori</i>
  cognitions, we rely upon <i>a priori</i> intuitions – space and time – which
  condition our representations of objects.<hr></li>
  <li>Everything in our cognition that belongs to space and time as intuitions
  is built up entirely from relations: of places in one intuition (extension),
  of the alteration of places (motion), and of laws which determine this
  alteration (moving forces). But what is <i>actually in the place</i> – that
  is, the content of a sensation – is not given by the intuitions of time and
  space which, together, provide only the <i>forms</i> of intuition. The forms
  of intuition <i>order</i> sensations, but concepts are needed to <i>unify</i>
  (or 'particularise') these sensations.
  <blockquote>
    "Now through mere relations no thing in itself is cognized; it is therefore
    right to judge that since nothing is given to us through outer sense except
    mere representations of relation, outer sense can also contain in its
    representation only the relation of an object to the subject, and not that
    which is internal to the object in itself." <b>(A49/B67)</b>
  </blockquote>
  Space (and time) is a <b>relational property</b> of things; it is therefore
  not <i>internal</i> to the things, and shouldn't be considered as a property
  of the things in themselves. It is simply assumed that relational properties
  aren't 'internal to the object': for instance, water has the <i>internal</i>
  property of being comprised of hydrogen and oxygen. It has the
  <i>relational</i> property of being in a glass; and, if it is taken out of
  this glass (and loses the relational property), it is still (presumably)
  the same thing. The relational properties of the water are therefore not
  internal to the water as an object. As such, everything that is represented
  to us after being taken in through the senses is only <i>appearance</i>. In
  conclusion: outer sense provides us only with appearances and not with things
  as they are in themselves.<hr>
  The same is true with <b>inner sense</b> (of which time is the form – see
  <a href="#timis">above</a>). Inner sense grounds the way in which
  representations are placed in our mind, by ordering them in time – allowing
  us to be conscious of representations occuring simultaneously, or in sequence,
  and so on. It therefore (like outer sense / space) contains nothing but
  <i>relations</i>; it is therefore a <b>form of intuition</b>. Inner sense
  represents nothing other than <i>how</i> things are posited in the mind, and
  it is therefore <i>'the way in which the mind is affected by its own
  activity'</i>. Since, as it was shown above, everything represented through
  (inner or outer) sense is merely <i>appearance</i>; it follows that the mind,
  through inner sense, is revealed to us only as appearance. Inner sense
  allows me to be conscious of my representations, in their determined order,
  but it does not make me aware of my <i>self</i> as the <i>subject</i> of
  my representations.<hr></li>
  <li>The claim that intuition represents outer objects and the self-intuition
  of the mind, in space and time, <i>as appearances</i>, does not equate to a
  claim that these objects are just illusions. In any appearance, the objects
  always appear to be something genuinely <i>given</i> The same is true for
  the qualities/properties we attribute to these objects. Any such qualified
  object (i.e. any such object with properties), insofar as its appearance is
  dependent on the subject's way of intuiting it, is distinguished <i>as
  appearance</i> from however it may be <i>in itself</i>. If we assumed instead
  that space and time were properties of things in themselves then, given that
  they are infinite, the absurdities that would arise would lead us to claim
  all bodies to be ideal, as Berkeley did.</li><hr>
  <li>As universal as the intuition of space is to finite objects, it remains
  an intuition regarding the <i>senses</i>, and cannot therefore be ascribed
  to supposed infinite beings, such as a god. As Kant writes in the
  <i>Inagural Dissertation</i>:
  <blockquote>
    "What, however, in immaterial substances constitutes the external relations
    of force between them or between them and bodies, obviously eludes the
    human intellect. … But when men reach the conception of a highest and
    extra-mundane Being, words cannot describe the extent to which they are
    deluded by these shades that flit before the mind. They picture God as
    present in a place: they entangle Him in the world where He is supposed to
    fill all space at once. They hope to make up for the limitation they thus
    impose by thinking of God's place <i>per eminentiam</i>, i.e. as infinite.
    But to be present in different places at the same time is absolutely
    impossible … what is in several places is outside itself, and is therefore
    present to itself outside itself – which is a contradiction in terms."
  </blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h3>Conclusion of the Transcendental Aesthetic.</h3>
<p>The first question of transcendental philosophy – namely: <b>how are
synthetic <i>a priori</i> propositions possible?</b> – is now closer to a
solution. Synthetic <i>a priori</i> propositions are possible through
<i>a priori</i> intuitions – space and time – which allow us to go beyond
the mere analysis of concepts in <i>a priori</i> judgments and make synthetic
claims, not by analysing the concept but by exploring the intuition that
corresponds to it. As such, however, such judgments will never go beyond
objects of the senses that belong to possible experience.</p>

<h1>Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, second part:
  <i>The Transcendental Logic</i></h1>

<h2 id="logic-int">Introduction: The Idea of a Transcendental Logic</h2>
<h3>I. On logic in general.</h3>
<p>All cognition arises from two sources in the mind: (1) the reception of
representations (or impressions), and (2) the faculty for cognizing an object
through these representations (the 'spontaneity of concepts'). The first
<b>gives</b> us an object, and through the latter the object is <b>thought</b>.
The elements of all cognition, therefore, are intuition and concepts. Concepts
without intuitions filling them cannot provide cognition, just as intuitions
without concepts to make sense of them can provide cognition. Such cognition
can be either <b>empirical</b> (if sensation is contained within it – that is,
if its object is actually present) or <b>pure</b> (if no sensation is
contained within it). Sensation is the 'matter' of sensible cognition; as such,
pure intuition contains only the 'form' of how things are intuited. Pure
concepts are simply the form of thinking an object in general. Empirical
intuitions and concepts are never possible <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<p>The above paragraph establishes that cognition arises from the reception
of representations, and the subsequent cognizing of a represented object – in
other words, the <i>thinking</i> of the object. The former stage is carried out
by the faculty named <b>sensibility</b>, the latter through the faculty named
<b>understanding</b>.</p>

<p>Intuition is always sensible, since it contains only the way in which the
mind is affected by an object. But the thinking of any intuition always takes
place in the understanding. Both the sensibility and the understanding are
necessary, and neither one has privilege over the other, since without the
sensibility, the understanding would have no object given to it; and without
the understanding, the sensibility would have its objects left unthought.
Concepts must be sensible and intuitions must be understandable.
<blockquote>
  "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind."
  <b>(A51/B75)</b>
</blockquote></p>

<p>The Transcendental Aesthetic concerned the rules of sensibility in general.
The Transcendental Logic concerns the rules of the understanding in general.
This logic can itself be divided into two parts, concerned with the rules of
either the <i>general</i> use of logic, or the <i>particular</i> use of it.
The former category is 'elementary logic' and contains the <i>necessary</i>
rules under which all thinking is conducted, without regard for the kind of
object being thought; the latter is concerned with different kinds of objects,
and therefore should be understood as the organon of any particular science that
corresponds to a particular kind of object.</p>

<p>Further classification can be made: general logic (the kind concerned with
the universal, object-agnostic rules of thinking) is either <i>pure</i> or
<i>applied</i>. Pure general logic abstracts from all empirical conditions –
i.e. the influence of the sense – that our understanding is typically exercised
on. It therefore abstracts from memory, habit, inclination, prejudice, the
imagination, and so on. As such, <b>pure</b> and <b>general</b> logic only
concerns itself with the <i>a priori</i> principles of thinking. It is therefore
a <b>canon of the understanding</b> (and of reason), regardless of the
understanding's potential content.</p>

<p>On the other hand, general reason is <b>applied</b> when it concerns the uses
of the understanding under empirical conditions. Nonetheless, it still takes
no concern of the different <i>kinds</i> of empirical objects, since it is still
<i>general</i> and therefore concerned with only necessary rules. Applied
general reason is therefore neither a canon of the understanding as such, nor
an organon of any particular science. It is 'merely a cathartic of the
common understanding'.</p>

<p>The present science (i.e. the critique of pure reason) will be concerned with
pure general reason, since that alone can be examined in the process of working
out the doctrine of the elements of the understanding. Two things must be
considered in this examination:
<ol>
  <li>Since we are concerned with <i>general</i> logic, we will not be concerned
  with the <i>content</i> of cognition, and will abstract away from the
  difference of objects, focusing only on the form of thinking.</li>
  <li>Since we are concerned with <i>pure</i> logic, we will consider no
  empirical (i.e. psychological) principles, and will arrive only at <i>a
  priori</i> (and therefore necessary) aspects of a doctrine.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Again, applied logic is not the focus of the Transcendental Logic; the
relationship between pure logic and applied logic is analogous to the
relationship between the laws of morality and the concrete ways in which
passions, feelings, and inclinations affect moral decision-making.</p>

<h3>II. On transcendental logic.</h3>

<p>(Note: from this point onwards, 'general logic' refers to 'pure general
logic' unless I state otherwise.)</p>

<p>General logic abstracts from the content of cognition – i.e. the relation
of cognition to the object – and examines only the form of the relations of
cognitions to one another, i.e. the form of <i>thinking</i> as such. It is also
indifferent to the source of cognition (i.e. whether it is from an empirical
intuition or a pure intuition), since it is only concerned with the <i>a
priori</i> rules of the understanding that <i>thinks</i> objects, regardless of
whether those objects are themselves <i>a priori</i> or not.</p>

<p>Since we are examining <i>transcendental</i> logic, it needs to be clear
which cognitions are transcendental and which are not. <b>Not every <i>a
priori</i> cognition is transcendental.</b> Transcendental cognitions are <i>a
priori</i> cognitions which we use to 'cognize that and how certain
representations (intuitions or concepts) are applied entirely <i>a priori</i>,
or are possible (i.e. the possibility of cognition or its use <i>a
priori</i>)'.</p>

<p>Since transcendental cognition is possible, we can expect that there are
concepts which correspond to objects <i>a priori</i>, and that are therefore
not of empirical or aesthetic origin. The Transcendental Logic is the science
of the cognitions that use such concepts; it is the science that determines the
origin and validity of cognitions by mean of which we think objects <i>a
priori</i>. The Transcendental Logic is concerned with the laws of the
understanding insofar as they relate to objects <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<h3>III. On the division of general logic into analytic and dialectic.</h3>
<p>A classic question which always provides a challenge to logicians is: <b>What
is Truth?</b> Kant presupposes the 'nominal definition' of truth – namely, that
it is the correspondence of a cognition with its object – but nonetheless, it
can still be asked: what is the truth <i>of a cognition</i>?</p>

<p>If truth is the correspondence (or 'agreement') of a cognition with its
object, then the object must be distinct from others, since a cognition isn't
true if it agrees with <i>some</i> object, but only the <i>particular</i> object
it is related with. We can say that one universal criterion of truth is that it
belongs only to cognitions whose <i>form</i> is <i>valid</i>: that is to say,
cognitions which express something that is either true or false (i.e. cognitions
which are truth-apt). But this criterion only concerns the <i>form</i> of
cognitions; what about their content or 'matter'? Well, content – that is,
actual things – cannot themselves have <i>a priori</i> criteria for truth, since
no empirical object is known <i>a priori</i>. As such, Kant concludes, 'no
general sign of the truth of the matter of cognition can be demanded, because it
  is self-contradictory'.</p>

<p>However, since we nonetheless can have criteria of truth when concerned with
the mere <i>form</i> of cognition, we can expect these criteria to be presented
in the rules of the understanding that our general logic outlines. Since any
cognition that contradicts the rules of the understanding is false, because any
such cognition would be the result of the understanding contradicting its own
rules, and thereby contradicting itself. It is important to note that, since
these rules serve only as truth-criteria for the <i>form</i> of cognition, they
are entirely correct and necessary, but not <i>sufficient</i> for the truth of a
cognition. After all, a cognition can still be true in form (i.e. not
contradictory), but still contradict its <i>object</i>. Logic will not attempt
to go further than the formal (i.e. logical) criterion of truth: that is, the
agreement of a cognition with the formal laws of reason and the
understanding.</p>

<hr>

<p>General logic contains an <b>analytic</b>, which analyses the faculties of
reason and the understanding into their elements, which are the principles of
the logical evaluation of our cognition. This establishes a <i>negative
criterion</i> of truth: i.e. "a cognition is true if it is <i>not</i> …". To
establish a positive criterion of truth for a cognition, we would have to
investigate its content; since its positive truth relies upon the relation to
its object rather than just its mere form. Mere logic cannot say anything about
the objects of cognition.</p>

<p>Note: an example of a negative criterion for the truth of a cognition is the
principle of non-contradiction. A cognition is true if it <i>doesn't</i>
contradict itself.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that logic may only provide negative criteria for the truth
of cognitions, there have nonetheless been philosophers (e.g. Wolff, Leibniz)
who have attempted to transform these criteria into <i>positive</i> criteria and
go on to construct metaphysical systems out of this transformation. This error
is equivalent to taking logic to be a <b>organon</b> for the production of
assertions, rather than merely a <b>canon</b> for judging them. Logic as canon
is called <b>analytic</b>; logic as organon is called <b>dialectic</b>.</p>

<p>The philosophers who fell into the trappings of dialectical logic only
provided 'the air of truth', by <i>imitating</i> practice that is thorough and
in accordance with the rules of logic. When general logic is taken as an
organon, it is <i>always</i> a 'logic of illusion'. It teaches us nothing about
cognitions and their content, but only 'the formal conditions of agreement with
the understanding' – it is 'idle chatter' that always forgets to consider the
content of cognitions and, without any authentic content grounding it, falls
into pretension.</p>

<h3>IV. On the division of transcendental logic into the transcendental analytic
  and dialectic.</h3>
<p>The transcendental aesthetic isolated the sensibility and considered only
those aspects of cognition which came from the sensibility. The transcendental
logic does the same, but with the understanding instead of the sensibility. We
thus arrive at an examination of pure cognition. The use of such cognition
depends upon the fact that there are objects given to us through intuition to
which pure cognition can be applied. Without intuition, cognitions would lack
objects and would therefore be empty.</p>

<p>The <b>transcendental analytic</b> presents the elements of the
understanding's pure cognition, and the principles without which no object can
be thought at all. The transcendental analytic is therefore also a <b>logic of
truth</b>: no cognition can contradict its rules without entirely losing its
content (i.e. its relation to any object) and therefore becoming false.</p>

<p>It is tempting to go beyond the actual use of the understanding's pure
cognitions, and attempt to make speculations with them without providing them
with content within the bounds of possible experience. To do so is to use logic
as an organon and not merely a canon for the empirical use of the understanding.
The second part of the transcendental logic is named the <b>transcendental
dialectic</b> and is dedicated to a critique of this erroneous, dialectical and
'hyperphysical' use of the understanding.</p>

<h2 id="logic-ana">Transcendental Logic, First Division: The Transcendental
  Analytic</h2>
<p>The transcendental analytic will analyse all our <i>a priori</i> cognition
and break it down into the elements of the understanding's pure cognition. It
maintains the following concerns throughout:
<ol>
  <li>Its concepts will be pure, rather than empirical</li>
  <li>Its concepts will belong to thinking and the understanding rather than
    intuition and the sensibility</li>
  <li>Its concepts will be <i>elementary</i>, distinguished from those which are
    derived or composed from elementary concepts</li>
  <li>The table of its concepts will be <i>complete</i>, making up an exhaustive
    account of pure understanding</li>
</ol></p>

<p>This list will not be satisfied by the aggregation of mere estimates; as
such, the transcendental analytic will begin with an idea of the <i>whole</i> of
<i>a priori</i> cognition and will establish, through the division of concepts,
each concept's connection to the others in a <b>system</b>. The pure
understanding is separated from all sensibility and all things empirical; it is
a systematic unity that can stand on its own. Taken all together, then, each
cognition within it is validated by all the others.</p>

<p>The transcendental analytic will be in two parts; the first concerns the
<b>concepts</b> of the pure understanding, and the latter concerns its
<b>principles</b>.</p>

<h2 id="ana-conc">Transcendental Analytic, First Book: The Analytic of
  Concepts</h2>
<p>The 'analytic of concepts' that takes place in this section isn't the typical
philosophical procedure of analysing concepts for the sake of increasing their
distinctness and clarity; rather, it is an analysis of the faculty of the
understanding itself, with the aim of finding out the possibility of <i>a
priori</i> concepts which originate in the understanding. These concepts 'lie
ready' in the understanding until experience is received by the mind and the
concepts are brought to use.</p>

<h3 id="meta-ded"><u>First Chapter of the Analytic of Concepts: <i>On the Clue
      to the Discovery of all Pure Concepts of the Understanding</i></u></h3>
<h3><i>(i.e. The Metaphysical Deduction)</i></h3>

<p>As the faculties of cognition are used, various concepts will arise which, as
they are brought to attention more often and thereby become more clarified, can
be collected in a reasonably exhaustive set. This way of discovering concepts
won't grasp them in any ordered or systematic way; however, the concepts can be
grouped according to their similarity, and they can be manually ordered on the
basis of their magnitude: 'from the simple to the more composite'. These ordered
groups are not <i>systematic</i>, though they are <i>methodically
produced</i>.</p>

<p>In seeking its concepts, transcendental philosophy must be conducted in
accordance with some principle, so that the place of each pure concept, and the
completeness of their totality, can be determined <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<h3>First Section: On the logical use of the understanding in general.</h3>
<p>The understanding has above been described negatively: it is a
<i>non-sensible</i> faculty of cognition. It is therefore <i>not</i> a faculty
of intuition, since intuition cannot occur without sensibility. The only other
way for cognition to occur is through <i>concepts</i> and, as such, this is the
way that the understanding works. It is <b>discursive</b> rather than
intuitive. While intuitions are based on 'affections'; concepts are based on
<b>functions</b>. A function is the act of <b>ordering different representations
under a common one</b>. Concepts therefore work with the <i>spontaneity</i> of
thinking, whereas intuitions work with the <i>receptivity</i> of impressions.
The only use of concepts is making judgments with them, since only intuitions
relate immediately to an object. A concept has no immediate relation with any
particular object; instead, it is related to some <i>representation</i> of an
object (whether that is an intuition, or another concept).</p>

<p>Kant gives an example of a judgment: <b>"All bodies are divisible"</b>. This
judgment contains the concept 'divisibility', which itself is related to the
concept of 'body'. The concept of 'body' relates to certain possible intuitions
that we receive; this is how the judgment is 'grounded' and actually refers to
something. As this example shows, concepts allow for the <i>unification</i> of
certain representations/intuitions. In a judgment such as this example, multiple
possible cognitions concerning <i>particular</i> representations are united in a
cognition concerning a <i>higher</i>, conceptual representation. This judgment
is made possible by the faculty of the understanding – as all judgments are.</p>

<p>The understanding is therefore a faculty for <b>thinking</b>, and 'thinking'
simply means cognition through concepts. The concepts involved in thoughts can
be understood as <i>predicates for possible judgments</i>.</p>

<h3>Second Section: On the logical function of the understanding in
  judgments.</h3>
<p>If we take any judgment, and abstract from its content until all we have left
is its form, which is provided by the understanding, then we find that its
fundamental functions can be brought under one of four titles, each of which
contains three different parts. This table represents this grouping of functions
of the understanding (I have coupled each part with an example judgment):</p>

<p>A note: the difference between <b>assertoric</b> and <b>apodictic</b>
judgments is that the former assert that something is or is not the case; the
latter assert that something is (or is not) the case <i>necessarily</i>.

<p>In some ways, this table differs from the traditional techniques of logic; as
such, there are some reasonable concerns and clarifications that Kant
raises:</p>

<p>1. The first protest is that singular judgments (e.g. A is B) are equivalent
to universal judgments (e.g. <i>All</i> A are B) because, in the former, the
predicate applies to <i>all</i> of the subject. <b>However</b>, the relationship
of singular judgments to universal ones, with regard to <i>quantity</i>, is the
same as the relationship of <i>unity</i> to <i>infinity</i>. <b>Therefore</b>,
singular judgments are distinct from universal judgments and deserve their own
place in the table.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, while general logic puts infinite judgments in the same category
as affirmative ones, transcendental logic keeps them separate. General logic has
no concern for the content of the predicate; it only considers whether it is
attributed or opposed to the subject. For the concerns of transcendental logic,
however, the content or value of the predicate has a bearing on cognition. Thus
to claim that "the soul is not mortal" is different from claiming that "the soul
is non-mortal"; the latter makes an actual affirmation.</p>

<p>3. There are three forms of relation in the table of judgments. Categorical
relations are relations between subject and predicate; hypothetical relations
are between the ground and the consequence; disjunctive relations are between
a divisible cognition and all the members of its division. As such, the first
two forms of relation can only relate two concepts (e.g. the proposition "if
there is perfect justice, then obstinate evil will be punished" links two
propositions – the one before "then" and the one after). In disjunctive
relations, however, there can be two or more propositions involved in the
relation: we could have, for example, the proposition: "The world exists either
through blind chance, or through inner necessity, or through an external
cause". <b>Note: During Kant's time (and generally during the time before
Frege's work), disjunctions in formal logic were typically taken to be
<i>exclusive</i>.</b> As such, Kant describes disjunctive judgments as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In a disjunctive judgment there is therefore a certain community of
cognitions, consisting in the fact that they mutually exclude each other, yet
thereby determine the true cognition <b>in its entirety</b>, since taken
together they constitute the entire content of a particular given
cognition." <b>(A74/B99)</b></blockquote>

<p>4. The function of modality is unique, in that it contributes nothing to the
content of the judgment (the content of a judgment is nothing more than its
quantity, quality, and relation). Instead, modality concerns the 'value of the
copula in relation to thinking in general'. Problematic judgments concern
assertions or denials that are only <i>possible</i>; assertoric judgments
concern assertions or denials that are <i>actual</i> (that is to say,
<i>actually true</i>); apodictic judgments are those which hold assertions or
denials to be <i>necessary</i>. As such, any hypothetical judgment ("If A then
B") contains two propositions ("A" and "B") that are merely problematic. The
three forms of modality can also be understood as 'so many moments of thinking
in general'; since thought so often involves something being judged
<i>problematically</i>, before it is assumed <i>assertorically</i> as true, and
then finally established as <i>apodictic</i>.

<h3>Third Section: On the pure concepts of the understanding or categories.</h3>

<p><b>Note</b>: I find this section very difficult; as such, I haven't written
a commentary that 'translates' each of Kant's points in order. Instead, I have
combined multiple secondary texts and Kant's text itself to 'translate' the
whole passage entirely. The secondary texts that have been consulted are:
  <ul>
    <li>"Kant on <i>a priori</i> concepts: The metaphysical deduction of the
      categories" by Béatrice Longuenesse in <i>The Cambridge Companion to Kant
      and Modern Philosophy</i> edited by Paul Guyer</li>
    <li>"The Metaphysical Deduction" in <i>Kant</i> by Paul Guyer</li>
  </ul></p>

<hr>

<p>Let's remember that our question is <i>how are synthetic a priori judgments
possible?</i> The first step towards an answer was completed by the
Transcendental Aesthetic, which proved the existence of space and time as <i>a
priori</i> intuitions that make experience possible. The second step, explored
here, consists in demonstrating that any such (synthetic <i>a priori</i>)
judgments about objects of experience are given <i>conceptual</i> content only
if (1) certain categories of the understanding order our representations (of
these objects), so that we can (2) form concepts about them, and (3) use these
concepts in judgments.</p>

<p>This section will arrive at a table of these categories. The following
section (the transcendental deduction) will prove their objective validity.
While Kant's predecessors, in the tradition of Aristotle, tried to give <i>a
priori</i> arguments for the categorical, universal features of <i>things in
themselves</i>, the metaphysical deduction only argues that our understanding is
so structured that it can only arrive at objective representations of
<i>appearances</i> by using the categories that the deduction discovers.</p>

<p>A reminder of the difference between <b>intuitions</b> and <b>concepts</b>.
Intuitions are <i>singular</i>, meaning that they are the representatives of
individual things; they are <i>immediate</i>, not requiring the mediation of
other representations in order to relate to an object. Concepts, on the other
hand, are <i>general</i>, representing not particular objects but
<i>properties</i> that can be common to several objects; they are
<i>mediate</i>, meaning that they can only relate to individual objects through
the mediation of other representations (i.e. intuitions).</p>

<p>In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant demonstrated that space and time are
<i>a priori</i> intuitions; they are forms of sensibility through which things
given to us by the senses are related to one another. Now, Kant will demonstrate
that we also have <i>concepts</i> innate to the mind which apply
<i>universally</i> to objects. These include existence, cause, necessity,
possibility, and substance. This discovery raises the question: how can concepts
that originate in our <i>minds</i> be applied to objects that are <i>given</i>?
Empirical objects and our concepts of them are supposed to be entirely
independent; how can the mind then bring them together?</p>

<p>In answering this question, Kant distinguishes the two ways in which the mind
grasps reality: through <i>receptivity</i> and through <i>spontaneity</i>. The
latter is the power of the sensibility – it is what allows the mind to be
affected and thereby receive representations; the latter is the understanding's
capacity to think over these representations and form concepts from them.</p>

<p>Both the mind's receptivity and its spontaneity have their own forms of
representation: the former provides intuitions, and the latter produces
concepts. Concepts are related to one another in judgments and inferences, and
all intuitions are themselves ordered within the single intuition of space and
the single intuition of time, both of which are <i>a priori</i>:

<blockquote>"Now space and time contain a manifold of pure a priori intuition,
but belong nevertheless among the conditions of the receptivity of our mind,
under which alone it can receive representations of objects, and thus they
must always also affect the concept of these objects." <b>(A77/B102)</b>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>If the first two sections of this chapter established the idea that <b>the
understanding is a capacity to make <i>judgments</i></b>, this third section
defends the thesis that <b>all judgments presuppose <i>synthesis</i></b>.</p>

<p>In some sense, this idea has been defended since Aristotle, who established
the fact that any judgment "A is B" involves a synthesis of the concept "A" with
the concept "B". But the Kantian notion of synthesis is separate from this. The
synthesis that is focused on here is that which allows concepts of sensible
objects to combined into judgments at all. Insofar as we are concerned with
concepts of sensible objects, judgments can only be made by <i>synthesising</i>
these concepts if their objects are themselves synthesised (and not just left as
a manifold of parts). <b>Transcendental logic is concerned with this synthesis
of intuited manifolds into distinct objects.</b>

<p>The reason such a synthesis is required in the first place is that, in order
for <i>analysis</i> of intuitions into concepts to take place, those intuitions,
which first appear as manifold, must first be <i>synthesised</i>.</p>

<p>In judgments that concern <i>a priori</i> manifold intuitions, synthesis can
take place simply through <i>a priori</i> concepts. For example, in geometrical
judgments, the concept of a 'triangle' is immediately presented as a synthesised
thing, because it is a merely spatial manifold, and space is an <i>a priori</i>
intuition. In <i>metaphysical</i> judgments, however, our objects are
independent of us and, as such, we do not come equipped with <i>a priori</i>
concepts for them.</p>

<p>How, then, do we construct representations of these independent objects? It
is not the way we construct mathematical representations, since the guidelines
for that process are given <i>a priori</i>. Instead, our mind <i>receives a
manifold of intuition</i>, and <i>unifies</i> it according to particular rules.
After this unification, analysis of the intuition can be made into concepts
which can then be thought in judgments.</p>

<p>Kant claims that "to bring this synthesis to concepts is a function that
pertains to the understanding and by means of which it first provides cognition
in the proper sense" (A78 / B103). The idea of <i>bringing synthesis to
concepts</i> can be illustrated as such: everything that is given to us in
sensibility is disperse and in disunity. Two similar sensible things (e.g. two
trees) couldn't be compared unless we grouped the intuitions that make them up
(i.e. intuition of leaves, a trunk, and so on) according to <i>regular
patterns</i>. But what determines <i>which</i> patterns are applied (i.e. why is
it that the concept of "tree" is leaves, branches, and trunk? Why not just
branches and trunk, leaving the leaves as a separate 'thing'?). The regularity
of our sensible concepts implies that the rules of synthesising these manifolds
must therefore by systematised in the understanding. This is the understanding's
bringing of "synthesis to concepts". In other words, the understanding provides
a <b>ground of unity</b> that allows synthesis to function. This ground of unity
is always a pure concept of the understanding.</p>

<p>As an example, Kant shows how we have the ability to count not only in
digits, but in tens, hundreds, and so on, thereby showing our ability to
synthesise collections of individual objects. This process of counting can be
applied to empirical objects (for example, when measuring the length of a line),
showing our ability to synthesise sensible manifolds.</p>

<p>It is at this point that Kant makes one of his most genius points so far:</p>

<blockquote>The same function that gives unity to the different representations
<b>in a judgment</b> also gives unity to the mere synthesis of different
representations <b>in an intuition</b>, which, expressed generally, is called
the pure concept of the understanding. The same understanding, therefore, and
indeed by means of the very same actions through which it brings the logical
form of a judgment into concepts by means of the analytical unity, also brings a
transcendental content into its representations by means of the synthetic unity
of the manifold in intuition in general, on account of which they are called
pure concepts of the understanding that pertain to object <i>a priori</i>; this
can never be accomplished by universal logic."</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is incredibly dense, but it seems to claim that if our
judgments have certain <i>necessary</i> forms (forms that the table of judgments
enumerated), then the <i>concepts of the objects</i> involved in those judgments
must also be structured in a specific necessary way, <i>so that we can use them
in these judgments</i>. If this is the case, then our <i>intuitions</i> (which
are the source of those objects, and the ultimate target of judgments) must
<i>also</i> be structured in certain necessary ways.</p>

<p>For instance – if a categorical judgment ("A is/belongs to B") asserts that a
particular predicate applies to a particular subject, then any object involved
in such a judgment must be understood as a <i>substance</i> [subject] with
<i>properties</i> [predicates]; further, we must therefore be able to
distinguish <i>substance</i> from <i>property</i> in our intuitions.</p>

<p>The categories should therefore be understood as concepts of objects in
general, which determine how those objects function in a judgment: for instance,
the concept of <i>substance</i> determines that any object that falls under such
a concept should be understood as the <i>subject</i> of a judgment.</p>

<p>It's important to note that categories do not stand for particular objects:
for example, the category of <i>accident</i> (i.e. property) doesn't refer to
'solidity', 'transparency', or any other particular property. It is instead the
<i>form</i> of properties in general, just as space and time are forms of
intuition. The difference here is that we intuit space and time as singular
objects, but the pure concepts that the categories represent are never intuited
as particulars.</p>

<p>Kant notes that there are an equal number of categories as there are
functions of judgment; this is because "the understanding is completely
exhausted and its capacity entirely measured by these functions" (A79 /
B105). This doesn't mean that the use of a particular function of judgment
implies a use of its corresponding category; a category only 'arises' when the
understanding's judging capacity is applied to sensible manifolds – these
manifolds become synthesised in intuition, analysed into concepts, and again
synthesised into judgments.</p>

<p>One thing to note in the table of categories is that, in each class, the
third category arises from the combination of the first two above it: for
example, totality 'is nothing other than plurality considered as a unity'
(B111). But these third categories aren't <i>merely derivative</i>; they are
still as 'ancestral' as the others, because the act of combining the first and
second categories of each class to form the third is a unique act of the
understanding.</p>

<h3 id="trans-ded"><u>Second Chapter of the Analytic of Concepts: <i>On the
      Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding</i></u></h3>
<h3><i>(i.e. The Transcendental Deduction)</i></h3>

<p>In legal theory, jurists distinguish between what is <i>lawful</i> and what
is <i>factual</i>. The proof of the former – i.e. the defence of a claim of
lawfulness – is known as a <i>deduction</i>. Though we make use of a variety of
empirical concepts very regularly, not all of them have a deduction: for
example, there is no justification from experience or reason for the use of the
concepts <i>fortune</i> and <i>fate</i>.</p>

<p>As it has been demonstrated above, some concepts can be used in a 'pure',
<i>a priori</i> way. As such, they lie before experience and cannot be justified
with referral to experience; their justification must therefore be deduced with
reason. Only following this justification can we know that these concepts, which
arise <i>independently of experience</i> can correctly apply to <i>objects of
  experience</i>. The process of giving this justification is called the
<b>transcendental deduction</b>. It is distinct from an <b>empirical
deduction</b>, which simply shows how a concept has been acquired from
experience, without giving any justification to the concept.</p>

<p>Space and time, along with all the categories, are <i>a priori</i> concepts
which apply to objects of experience, and only a <i>transcendental</i> deduction
of them is possible. It might be objected that we can do as Locke did, and look
to experience to see which kind of impressions give rise to the use of these
concepts, thereby going from <i>individual perceptions</i> to <i>general
concepts</i>. However, this is not possible for <i>a priori</i> concepts: such a
method – a 'physiological derivation' – only explains our <i>possession</i> of
these pure <i>a priori</i> concepts; it does not justify them. As such, any
deduction of these concepts must be transcendental.</p>

<p>A critic might then object: is a transcendental deduction really the
<i>only</i> method available to us? After all, geometry can prove its claims
<i>a priori</i> without having to resort to a philosophical justification of its
central concept (space). Geometry, however, is different insofar as it is
grounded on intuition which is given <i>a priori</i> (the pure intuition of
space); as such, both its <i>form</i> and its <i>content</i> are already given.
With the pure <i>a priori</i> concepts of the understanding, a transcendental
deduction is still needed, because these concepts apply to objects in
<i>general</i>, without any conditions of sensibility. They aren't presented
with objects from <i>a priori</i> intuitions on which to ground their synthesis,
as geomtry is. Furthermore, a transcendental deduction is needed to delimit the
<i>valid</i> (i.e. justified) use of these concepts, to prevent their use beyond
the boundaries of possible experience.</p>

<p>The Transcendental Analytic straightforwardly gave a deduction of the pure
concepts of space and time, because space and time are, evidently, the
conditions of possibility for the appearance of objects in general. Deducing the
<i>categories</i>, however, is a more difficult task, since objects can
be intuited by us without being related to particular categories. The categories
do, however, provide the condition of possibility of <i>cognizing</i> objects;
we therefore have to ask the difficult question of <b>how subjective cognitions
of thinking can apply to objects with objective validity</b>.

<p>We know that objects must comply with the conditions of <i>sensibility</i>,
or else they wouldn't be objects for us at all. It is harder to determine why
they must, necessarily, also comply with the "conditions that the understanding
requires for the synthetic unity of thinking" (A90 / B123). Hypothetically,
appearances could come to us without any conformity to the conditions of the
understanding, in a state of complete confusion wherein concepts such as cause
and effect wouldn't apply and would therefore be empty. In this scenario,
the mind would still intuit appearances, but the objects of these appearances
would simply be unthinkable.</p>

<p>We cannot do as Hume did and claim that concepts come from habitual
generalisation of regular occurrences; if the categories are to have objective
validity then they must originate <i>a priori</i> in the understanding;
otherwise, they are just fantasies. "To the synthesis of cause and effect there
attahces a dignity that can never be expressed empirically" (A91 / B124)
– namely, <i>necessity</i>.</p>

<h3>Transition to the Transcendental Deduction</h3>
<p>There are two ways of synthetic representations joining up with objects:
<ol>
  <li><b>The object alone makes the representation possible</b>: this is an
    empirical relation, and therefore holds no necessity; the representation
    isn't possible <i>a priori</i>.</li>
  <li><b>The representation alone makes the object possible</b>: 'representation
    in itself' doesn't bring objects into <i>existence</i>, but is what allows
    them to be cognized as objects in the first place.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>With regard to the second way: there are two ways that an object can be
cognized: either through <u>intuitions</u> (the object is given as appearance)
or through <u>concept</u> (the object is thought, in correspondence to an
intuition). We know that <i>intuition</i> is subject to <i>a priori</i> rules
(as the Transcendental Aesthetic established). We must therefore ask if <i>a
priori</i> <i><u>concepts</u></i> also condition the way that objects are
thought as objects, in a way that – like the <i>a priori</i> forms of intuition
– doesn't allow objects to be cognized without them.</p>

<p>All experience contains intuitions and concepts of the experienced object,
and concepts are therefore <i>a priori</i> conditions of experiential cognition;
as such, if the categories have <i>objective validity</i> it must be the case
that they are necessary conditions for experience in general, since only through
them can objects of experience be thought at all.</p>

<p>The Transcendental Deduction is therefore directed at recognising the
categories as <i>a priori</i> conditions of the possibility of experience. Any
analysis of the experience in which the categories are encountered will not
serve as a deduction, since this would show them only in a state of
contingency.</p>

<p><b>Locke</b> went about in this way, deriving pure concepts from experience;
this gave his project such an <i>inconsistent grounding</i> that he then
attempted to cognize beyond the limits of possible experience.
<b>Hume</b> recognised that, in order to make cognitions of such a sort, the
pure concepts would have to be necessary and <i>a priori</i>; however, he failed
to establish how they could be so, since he never thought to look to the
<i>understanding</i> as their origin. Hume's empirical approach is refuted
simply by the fact that we <i>do</i>have disciplines of <i>a priori</i>
certainty, such as pure mathematics.</p>

<p>The paragraph above shows how Locke embodied philosophical "enthusiasm", and
Hume embodied "skepticism". The Transcendental Deduction will show how we can
safely navigate between these two extremes.</p>
