<h1>The Critique of Pure Reason</h1>
<h2>Preface to the First Edition</h2>

<p>Reason functions by beginning with fundamental principles that allow it
to make sense of nature. As it progresses, it abstracts from these principles
and reaches areas that are more and more remote; this continues until reason
reaches an inevitable stage at which it asks itself questions that it cannot
answer. This stage is known as <b>metaphysics</b>.</p>

<p>Metaphysics was once seen as the 'queen' of all the sciences; it is now
despised and seen as an outcast.</p>

<p>When metaphysics still reigned, <b>dogmatists</b> allowed it to 'rule
despotically'; but the dogmas of the different dogmatists clashed to such an
extent that <b>skeptics</b> came along and pushed all metaphysics and 'civil
unity' into disarray. Following this, the dogmatists would come again and try
to piece things back together, in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Some philosophers, such as Locke, tried to test the 'lawfulness' of these
different dogmatisms, by examining through a 'physiology' of human
understanding. But even though this rendered dogmatic thought as suspicious,
dogmatisms continued to assert themselves, since 'this genealogy was attributed
to [metaphysics] falsely'.</p>

<p>Following these pursuits, all of which were in vain, the general attitude
towards metaphysics was one best described as <b>indifferentism</b>. But it is
a kind of indifferentism that leads to metaphysical confusion in the first
place! The indifferentists, therefore, always fall back into metaphysics. This
phenomenon ought to be examined.</p>

<p>In this examination, a kind of 'court of justice' will be established, for
reason to arrive at a state of self-knowledge, wherein it can 'secure its
rightful claims while dismissing all its groundless pretensions … according to
its own eternal and unchangeable laws'. This court is the <b>critique of pure
reason</b>, the critique of the faculty of reason insofar as it can arrive
at cognitions <b>independently of experience</b>. It is therefore, at the same
time, an answer to the question of whether or not metaphysics is possible, and
of what the origin of metaphysical thinking is.</p>

<p>No questions in the critique of pure reason will be avoided by using reason's
inadequacy as an excuse; instead, they will be reformulated so as to accommodate
the nature of reason.</p>

<p>'Comprehensiveness' is the 'chief aim' of the critique, and as such it
answers all metaphysical problems. In fact, pure reason is rightly treated
as a 'pure unity'; as such, if any aspect of it was unsuitable for one
question, it would be discarded for all other questions: if it fails for one
question, it is unreliable for any others.</p>

<p>Kant acknowledges that his promises sound immodest; however, he argues that
they are more modest than the philosophers that claim to possess knowledge on
the human 'soul' or on the beginning of the universe. Kant merely promises to
gain an exhaustive understanding of the human faculty of reason. The critique
of pure reason only concerns itself with the claims that can be made with
necessity.</p>

<p>The book is difficult, but Kant suggests that 'many a book would have been
much clearer if it had not been made quite so clear': giving too many examples,
illustrations, and reductions of complicated topics into common concepts might
help to clarify a part, but will only confuse the whole.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Second Edition</h2>

<p>Is the examination of the cognitions of pure reason a science? If, while
we are carrying it out, we find ourselves having to scrap our progress and
go down another path; if we get completely stuck after making sensible
preliminaries; if we can never agree on how to establish our path in the first
place – in any of these cases, we will realise that it is not a science.</p>

<p>Logic, for example, has never had to reroute itself since the time of
Aristotle. Nor has it found the need to take extra steps – apart from those
which have been psychological, metaphysical, or anthropological, all of which
Kant dismisses as distortions of the boundaries of logic as a science. Logic
has had such success because it concerns itself only with the form of
understanding, and is abstracted away from all potential objects of
cognition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is more difficult when a science considers not only
cognition but the objects of cognition. Whenever a science has an object, it
must involve some <i>a priori</i> cognition: either the object is determined
and its concept is brought about, or the object is actualised. The former
kind of reasoning is <b>theoretical</b>; the latter is <b>practical</b>. In
both kinds of reasoning, the kind of object that the reasoning concerns itself
with is determined <i>a priori</i>, or else the reasoning would end up being
misapplied, 'for it is bad economy to spend blindly'.</p>

<p>Unlike mathematics and the natural sciences, which have managed to earn the
status of being scientific, metaphysics has always lost itself – despite the
aforementioned fact that metaphysical thinking seems to be forced upon us by
nature. We might, therefore, reflect on what kinds of thinking have been
beneficial for mathematics and the natural sciences, and approach metaphysics
with a similar kind of thinking.</p>

<p>We have typically assumed that all cognition must conform to its objects;
however, at least in the case of metaphysics, this has got us nowhere. At least
for the sake of experiment, then, it is worthwhile to approach metaphysics with
the assumption that objects must conform to our cognition. This would allow us
to have an <i>a priori</i> idea of what our objects are which, as previously
argued, is required for scientific thinking.</p>

<p>Approaching metaphysics in this (scientific) manner will allow us to
determine if we are getting an accurate picture of the objects of metaphysics,
simply by asking: does this conform to the rules of our cognition? Admittedly,
this strength also comes with the disadvantage that we can only make <i>a
priori</i> cognitions of objects regarding those aspects that we ourselves have
'put into' them. This also means that we cannot go beyond the boundaries of
possible experience which, at least traditionally, is the purpose of
metaphysics.</p>

<p>If we go along with the assumption that objects conform to our knowledge,
then we must accept that all of our cognitions only reach the <b>appearances</b>
of things; there is therefore an <b>unconditioned</b> aspect of things in
themselves which we cannot cognize, and it is this unconditioned that drives us
towards the confusions of metaphysical thinking. Importantly, the notion of
the unconditioned is only possible if we accept that objects conform to
knowledge; if we make the opposite assumption, the notion of the unconditioned
is contradictory.</p>

<p>Having accepted that theoretical reason cannot cognize the unconditioned,
Kant claims that we must test whether or not practical reason can make such
cognitions: "what still remains for us is to try whether there are not data in
reason's practical data for determining that transcendent rational concept of
the unconditioned, in such a way as to reach beyond the boundaries of all
possible experience, in accordance with the wishes of metaphysics, cognitions
<i>a priori</i> that are possible, but only from a practical standpoint". This
is done in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>.</p>

<p>What will be the results of a critique of pure reason? Firstly, we will be
given a system of principles in which each principle depends upon all the
others; no principle can be taken with certainty on its own unless it works
in relation to the entirety of pure reason. Since these principles are based
solely off of the structure of human reasoning, they will never be appended to
or subtracted from; as such, once (critical) metaphysics has established itself
as a science, it can be laid 'down for posterity', as a <b>complete
framework</b>. This is a unique luxury that the natural sciences don't have.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there is a <b>negative</b> side to critical metaphysics, in that
it is strict about the limitation of pure reason, 'teaching us never to venture
with speculative reasoning beyond the boundaries of experience'. However, it is
actually <b>positive</b> insofar as it completely prevents the negative
consequences of pre-critical metaphysics: namely, the tendency to go beyond
the limits of experience and thereby limits (or even prevents) the use of
practical reasoning. As such, the critique of pure reason is giving a greater
respect to the requirements of practical moral reasoning.</p>

<p>It has already been established that the critique will show that we cannot
cognize things as they are in themselves. This doesn't mean, however, that we
cannot even <i>think</i> of things in themselves; we can, because without such
an ability we would have to assume that there are representations without
things to represent. This twofold conception of the object also allows us to
consider particular things in twofold manners – for example, to consider the
human soul as sensibly determined by the laws of nature, but intellectually (in
itself) free. I cannot <i>cognize</i> myself as free, but I can <i>think</i>
myself to be that way, without any contradiction. This is a requirement of
moral practical reasoning, because without freedom there can be no moral
decisions. It is also, Kant will argue, necessary to assume the existence of
God and immortality for practical reasoning to succeed, and these assumptions
cannot be made without the limitations that the critical project places on
pure reason.</p>

<p>The critique of pure reason is therefore a beneficial project. Kant defends
this point further by pointing out that the endeavours of pre-critical
metaphysics – ontological and cosmological arguments for God, defences of free
will on the basis of 'powerless distinctions', adn so on – have never actually
benefitted the public, only the scholars. As such, the systematic disproval of
these endeavours is only a drawback to scholars who wish to speculate endlessly
without concern for social or pedagogical benefit.</p>
