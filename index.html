<h1>The Critique of Pure Reason</h1>
<h2>Preface to the First Edition</h2>

<p>Reason functions by beginning with fundamental principles that allow it
to make sense of nature. As it progresses, it abstracts from these principles
and reaches areas that are more and more remote; this continues until reason
reaches an inevitable stage at which it asks itself questions that it cannot
answer. This stage is known as <b>metaphysics</b>.</p>

<p>Metaphysics was once seen as the 'queen' of all the sciences; it is now
despised and seen as an outcast.</p>

<p>When metaphysics still reigned, <b>dogmatists</b> allowed it to 'rule
despotically'; but the dogmas of the different dogmatists clashed to such an
extent that <b>skeptics</b> came along and pushed all metaphysics and 'civil
unity' into disarray. Following this, the dogmatists would come again and try
to piece things back together, in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Some philosophers, such as Locke, tried to test the 'lawfulness' of these
different dogmatisms, by examining through a 'physiology' of human
understanding. But even though this rendered dogmatic thought as suspicious,
dogmatisms continued to assert themselves, since 'this genealogy was attributed
to [metaphysics] falsely'.</p>

<p>Following these pursuits, all of which were in vain, the general attitude
towards metaphysics was one best described as <b>indifferentism</b>. But it is
a kind of indifferentism that leads to metaphysical confusion in the first
place! The indifferentists, therefore, always fall back into metaphysics. This
phenomenon ought to be examined.</p>

<p>In this examination, a kind of 'court of justice' will be established, for
reason to arrive at a state of self-knowledge, wherein it can 'secure its
rightful claims while dismissing all its groundless pretensions … according to
its own eternal and unchangeable laws'. This court is the <b>critique of pure
reason</b>, the critique of the faculty of reason insofar as it can arrive
at cognitions <b>independently of experience</b>. It is therefore, at the same
time, an answer to the question of whether or not metaphysics is possible, and
of what the origin of metaphysical thinking is.</p>

<p>No questions in the critique of pure reason will be avoided by using reason's
inadequacy as an excuse; instead, they will be reformulated so as to accommodate
the nature of reason.</p>

<p>'Comprehensiveness' is the 'chief aim' of the critique, and as such it
answers all metaphysical problems. In fact, pure reason is rightly treated
as a 'pure unity'; as such, if any aspect of it was unsuitable for one
question, it would be discarded for all other questions: if it fails for one
question, it is unreliable for any others.</p>

<p>Kant acknowledges that his promises sound immodest; however, he argues that
they are more modest than the philosophers that claim to possess knowledge on
the human 'soul' or on the beginning of the universe. Kant merely promises to
gain an exhaustive understanding of the human faculty of reason. The critique
of pure reason only concerns itself with the claims that can be made with
necessity.</p>

<p>The book is difficult, but Kant suggests that 'many a book would have been
much clearer if it had not been made quite so clear': giving too many examples,
illustrations, and reductions of complicated topics into common concepts might
help to clarify a part, but will only confuse the whole.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Second Edition</h2>

<p>Is the examination of the cognitions of pure reason a science? If, while
we are carrying it out, we find ourselves having to scrap our progress and
go down another path; if we get completely stuck after making sensible
preliminaries; if we can never agree on how to establish our path in the first
place – in any of these cases, we will realise that it is not a science.</p>

<p>Logic, for example, has never had to reroute itself since the time of
Aristotle. Nor has it found the need to take extra steps – apart from those
which have been psychological, metaphysical, or anthropological, all of which
Kant dismisses as distortions of the boundaries of logic as a science. Logic
has had such success because it concerns itself only with the form of
understanding, and is abstracted away from all potential objects of
cognition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is more difficult when a science considers not only
cognition but the objects of cognition. Whenever a science has an object, it
must involve some <i>a priori</i> cognition: either the object is determined
and its concept is brought about, or the object is actualised. The former
kind of reasoning is <b>theoretical</b>; the latter is <b>practical</b>. In
both kinds of reasoning, the kind of object that the reasoning concerns itself
with is determined <i>a priori</i>, or else the reasoning would end up being
misapplied, 'for it is bad economy to spend blindly'.</p>
